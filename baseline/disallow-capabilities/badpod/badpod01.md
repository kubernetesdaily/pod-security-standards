## Understanding Capabilities

In Linux, capabilities are a fine-grained way of granting specific privileges to processes without granting them full root access. The NET_RAW capability allows processes to create raw sockets, which can be used for packet sniffing and other low-level network operations.

## Security Implications of NET_RAW

- Packet Sniffing: With NET_RAW, a process can intercept and manipulate network traffic. This can be exploited to capture sensitive data such as passwords, session tokens, or other confidential information.

- Network Attacks: Raw sockets can be used to craft custom network packets. This capability can be exploited to launch network attacks, such as:
ARP Spoofing: Manipulating ARP tables to redirect traffic.
ICMP Attacks: Sending custom ICMP packets for denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
TCP/UDP Attacks: Crafting malicious TCP or UDP packets to exploit vulnerabilities in network services.

Sure, let's go through an example of an attack that could be executed if the `NET_RAW` capability were allowed in a container.

### Example Attack: ARP Spoofing

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing is a common network attack where an attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a local network. This results in the linking of the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. Once the attacker is linked to an IP address, they can intercept, modify, or block data intended for that IP address.

### Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes Pod with the `NET_RAW` capability.
- Tools like `arpspoof` and `tcpdump` installed in the container.

### YAML Example of a Pod with `NET_RAW`

This example is for illustrative purposes only. Allowing `NET_RAW` in production environments is not recommended due to security risks.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: attackpod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: attacker
    image: busybox
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add:
        - NET_RAW  # Disallowed in secure policies
    command: ["sh", "-c", "sleep 100000"]
```

### ARP Spoofing Attack

Once the Pod is running, the attacker can execute ARP spoofing from within the container.

1. **Install Necessary Tools**

   First, install `arpspoof` and `tcpdump` in the container (if not already present):

   ```sh
   kubectl exec -it attackpod -- sh
   apk update && apk add dsniff tcpdump
   ```

2. **Execute ARP Spoofing**

   The attacker uses `arpspoof` to send falsified ARP responses. For example, to intercept traffic between a victim machine with IP `192.168.1.10` and the gateway `192.168.1.1`:

   ```sh
   arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.1
   arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.10
   ```

   This will poison the ARP cache of the victim machine and the gateway, making them believe the attacker's MAC address is associated with the other machine's IP address.

3. **Intercept Network Traffic**

   With the ARP cache poisoned, the attacker can now intercept traffic. Using `tcpdump` to capture packets:

   ```sh
   tcpdump -i eth0 -w /tmp/capture.pcap
   ```

   The attacker can then analyze the captured packets for sensitive information, such as unencrypted passwords, session tokens, or other data.

### Why This is Dangerous

- **Data Interception**: The attacker can see all the data being sent and received by the victim machine, which can include sensitive information.
- **Data Modification**: The attacker can modify the data packets in transit, potentially injecting malicious content or altering legitimate communications.
- **Denial of Service**: By manipulating ARP responses, the attacker can disrupt network communications, leading to denial of service for the victim machine.

### Mitigation

By disallowing the `NET_RAW` capability, you prevent containers from creating raw sockets, which are necessary for ARP spoofing and other low-level network attacks. This significantly reduces the attack surface within your Kubernetes cluster.

### Policy Enforcement

A policy that disallows `NET_RAW` ensures that any attempt to add this capability to a Pod will be denied, thereby preventing the execution of such attacks. Here's the policy YAML for reference:

```yaml
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sPSPAllowedCapabilities
metadata:
  name: disallow-capabilities
spec:
  match:
    kinds:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        kinds: ["Pod"]
  parameters:
    allowedCapabilities:
      - AUDIT_WRITE
      - CHOWN
      - DAC_OVERRIDE
      - FOWNER
      - FSETID
      - KILL
      - MKNOD
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
      - SETFCAP
      - SETGID
      - SETPCAP
      - SETUID
      - SYS_CHROOT
  validation:
    message: >-
      Any capabilities added beyond the allowed list (AUDIT_WRITE, CHOWN, DAC_OVERRIDE, FOWNER,
      FSETID, KILL, MKNOD, NET_BIND_SERVICE, SETFCAP, SETGID, SETPCAP, SETUID, SYS_CHROOT)
      are disallowed.
    deny:
      conditions:
        all:
          - key: "spec.containers[*].securityContext.capabilities.add"
            operator: NotIn
            values:
              - AUDIT_WRITE
              - CHOWN
              - DAC_OVERRIDE
              - FOWNER
              - FSETID
              - KILL
              - MKNOD
              - NET_BIND_SERVICE
              - SETFCAP
              - SETGID
              - SETPCAP
              - SETUID
              - SYS_CHROOT
```

This policy ensures that any Pod attempting to add the `NET_RAW` capability will be denied, effectively preventing the execution of such network attacks within the Kubernetes cluster.
