Given the example Pod definition with the `NET_RAW` (disallowed) and `SETGID` (allowed) capabilities, let's discuss another potential attack that can be executed if the `NET_RAW` capability were permitted.

### YAML 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: badpod02
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container01
    image: busybox
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add:
        - NET_RAW  # Disallowed capability
        - SETGID   # Allowed capability
```

### Example Attack: ICMP Flooding (Ping Flood)

ICMP flooding, or ping flooding, is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack where an attacker sends a large number of ICMP Echo Request (ping) packets to the target system, overwhelming it with network traffic and potentially causing it to become unresponsive.

### Steps to Perform an ICMP Flood Attack

Assuming the `NET_RAW` capability is available in the container, here's how an attacker could perform an ICMP flood attack:

1. **Install Necessary Tools**

   First, install `busybox-extras` in the container to get access to the `ping` command:

   ```sh
   kubectl exec -it badpod02 -- sh
   apk update && apk add busybox-extras
   ```

2. **Execute ICMP Flood**

   The attacker uses the `ping` command to flood the target IP address with ICMP Echo Requests:

   ```sh
   ping -f -s 65507 192.168.1.10
   ```

   - `-f`: Flood ping. Sends packets as fast as possible.
   - `-s 65507`: Sets the packet size to the maximum value allowed by the protocol, increasing the load on the target system.
   - `192.168.1.10`: The IP address of the target system.

### Impact of ICMP Flooding

- **Network Congestion**: The target system and the network can become congested with the high volume of ICMP traffic, affecting other systems on the same network.
- **Resource Exhaustion**: The target system may consume significant CPU and memory resources to process the flood of ICMP requests, potentially leading to system slowdown or crash.
- **Denial of Service**: Legitimate users may experience degraded network performance or complete denial of access to network services.

### Example Error Message

If the policy disallows `NET_RAW`, attempting to create the Pod would result in an error message, as explained earlier:

```
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "badpod02.yaml": admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: Any capabilities added beyond the allowed list (AUDIT_WRITE, CHOWN, DAC_OVERRIDE, FOWNER, FSETID, KILL, MKNOD, NET_BIND_SERVICE, SETFCAP, SETGID, SETPCAP, SETUID, SYS_CHROOT) are disallowed.
```

### Preventing the Attack

To prevent such attacks, ensure the `NET_RAW` capability is disallowed by the security policy. Hereâ€™s a policy example:

```yaml
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sPSPAllowedCapabilities
metadata:
  name: disallow-capabilities
spec:
  match:
    kinds:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        kinds: ["Pod"]
  parameters:
    allowedCapabilities:
      - AUDIT_WRITE
      - CHOWN
      - DAC_OVERRIDE
      - FOWNER
      - FSETID
      - KILL
      - MKNOD
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
      - SETFCAP
      - SETGID
      - SETPCAP
      - SETUID
      - SYS_CHROOT
  validation:
    message: >-
      Any capabilities added beyond the allowed list (AUDIT_WRITE, CHOWN, DAC_OVERRIDE, FOWNER,
      FSETID, KILL, MKNOD, NET_BIND_SERVICE, SETFCAP, SETGID, SETPCAP, SETUID, SYS_CHROOT)
      are disallowed.
    deny:
      conditions:
        all:
          - key: "spec.containers[*].securityContext.capabilities.add"
            operator: NotIn
            values:
              - AUDIT_WRITE
              - CHOWN
              - DAC_OVERRIDE
              - FOWNER
              - FSETID
              - KILL
              - MKNOD
              - NET_BIND_SERVICE
              - SETFCAP
              - SETGID
              - SETPCAP
              - SETUID
              - SYS_CHROOT
```

By enforcing this policy, Kubernetes clusters can effectively mitigate the risk of such ICMP flood attacks and other potential threats associated with the `NET_RAW` capability.
