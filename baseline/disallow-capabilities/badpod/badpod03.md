Let's use the provided example Pod definition to illustrate a potential attack using the `NET_RAW` capability. 

### Pod YAML Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: badpod03
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container01
    image: busybox
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add:
        - NET_RAW  # Disallowed capability
  - name: container02
    image: busybox
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add:
        - SETGID   # Allowed capability
```

### Example Attack: DNS Spoofing

DNS spoofing, also known as DNS cache poisoning, is an attack where false DNS information is introduced into the DNS resolver's cache, causing the resolver to return an incorrect IP address. This can redirect traffic from a legitimate server to a malicious one.

### Steps to Perform a DNS Spoofing Attack

1. **Install Necessary Tools**

   First, install necessary tools like `dsniff` in the container:

   ```sh
   kubectl exec -it badpod03 -c container01 -- sh
   apk update && apk add dsniff
   ```

2. **Set Up a Fake DNS Response**

   Using `arpspoof` and `dnsspoof` from the `dsniff` package, the attacker can perform a DNS spoofing attack. Here is how:

   **a. Run `arpspoof` to Redirect Traffic**

   ```sh
   arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.1
   arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.10
   ```

   This poisons the ARP cache of both the victim (`192.168.1.10`) and the gateway (`192.168.1.1`), making the attacker the man-in-the-middle.

   **b. Run `dnsspoof` to Respond with Fake DNS Records**

   Create a file `hosts.txt` with fake DNS records:

   ```sh
   echo "192.168.1.50 example.com" > hosts.txt
   ```

   Run `dnsspoof`:

   ```sh
   dnsspoof -i eth0 -f hosts.txt
   ```

   This will respond to DNS queries for `example.com` with the IP address `192.168.1.50` (the attacker's IP or a malicious server's IP).

### Impact of DNS Spoofing

- **Traffic Redirection**: Users trying to visit `example.com` will be redirected to a malicious server controlled by the attacker.
- **Credential Theft**: If the attacker sets up a fake website that mimics the legitimate one, they can capture usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information.
- **Malware Distribution**: The attacker can serve malware from the fake website, compromising the victim's machine.

### Why `NET_RAW` is Disallowed

The `NET_RAW` capability allows the container to create raw sockets, which are essential for packet crafting and network sniffing tools like `arpspoof` and `dnsspoof`. By disallowing `NET_RAW`, Kubernetes policies prevent containers from performing these types of attacks.

### Preventing the Attack

The security policy should disallow `NET_RAW` to mitigate such risks. Hereâ€™s how you can enforce this:

```yaml
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sPSPAllowedCapabilities
metadata:
  name: disallow-capabilities
spec:
  match:
    kinds:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        kinds: ["Pod"]
  parameters:
    allowedCapabilities:
      - AUDIT_WRITE
      - CHOWN
      - DAC_OVERRIDE
      - FOWNER
      - FSETID
      - KILL
      - MKNOD
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
      - SETFCAP
      - SETGID
      - SETPCAP
      - SETUID
      - SYS_CHROOT
  validation:
    message: >-
      Any capabilities added beyond the allowed list (AUDIT_WRITE, CHOWN, DAC_OVERRIDE, FOWNER,
      FSETID, KILL, MKNOD, NET_BIND_SERVICE, SETFCAP, SETGID, SETPCAP, SETUID, SYS_CHROOT)
      are disallowed.
    deny:
      conditions:
        all:
          - key: "spec.containers[*].securityContext.capabilities.add"
            operator: NotIn
            values:
              - AUDIT_WRITE
              - CHOWN
              - DAC_OVERRIDE
              - FOWNER
              - FSETID
              - KILL
              - MKNOD
              - NET_BIND_SERVICE
              - SETFCAP
              - SETGID
              - SETPCAP
              - SETUID
              - SYS_CHROOT
```

### Expected Error Message

If the policy disallows `NET_RAW`, attempting to create `badpod03` will result in an error:

```
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "badpod03.yaml": admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: Any capabilities added beyond the allowed list (AUDIT_WRITE, CHOWN, DAC_OVERRIDE, FOWNER, FSETID, KILL, MKNOD, NET_BIND_SERVICE, SETFCAP, SETGID, SETPCAP, SETUID, SYS_CHROOT) are disallowed.
```

### Summary

By enforcing policies that disallow the `NET_RAW` capability, Kubernetes clusters can effectively prevent containers from executing network attacks such as DNS spoofing, ARP spoofing, and other malicious activities that require raw socket access. This helps maintain the security and integrity of the cluster and its network environment.
