Let's use the provided example Pod definition to illustrate a potential attack using the `NET_RAW` capability in an init container.

### Pod YAML Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: badpod04
spec:
  initContainers:
  - name: initcontainer01
    image: busybox
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add:
        - NET_RAW  # Disallowed capability
  containers:
  - name: container01
    image: busybox
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add:
        - SETGID   # Allowed capability
```

### Example Attack: ARP Spoofing from Init Container

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing is an attack where an attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a local network. This can link the attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network, allowing the attacker to intercept, modify, or block data.

### Steps to Perform an ARP Spoofing Attack

1. **Install Necessary Tools**

   First, install necessary tools like `arpspoof` in the init container:

   ```sh
   kubectl exec -it badpod04 -c initcontainer01 -- sh
   apk update && apk add dsniff
   ```

2. **Execute ARP Spoofing**

   Use `arpspoof` to send falsified ARP responses. For example, to intercept traffic between a victim machine with IP `192.168.1.10` and the gateway `192.168.1.1`:

   ```sh
   arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.1
   arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.10
   ```

   This will poison the ARP cache of both the victim machine and the gateway, making them believe the attacker's MAC address is associated with the other machine's IP address.

3. **Intercept Network Traffic**

   With the ARP cache poisoned, the attacker can intercept traffic. Using `tcpdump` to capture packets:

   ```sh
   tcpdump -i eth0 -w /tmp/capture.pcap
   ```

   The attacker can then analyze the captured packets for sensitive information, such as unencrypted passwords, session tokens, or other data.

### Impact of ARP Spoofing

- **Data Interception**: The attacker can see all the data being sent and received by the victim machine, which can include sensitive information.
- **Data Modification**: The attacker can modify the data packets in transit, potentially injecting malicious content or altering legitimate communications.
- **Denial of Service**: By manipulating ARP responses, the attacker can disrupt network communications, leading to denial of service for the victim machine.

### Why `NET_RAW` is Disallowed

The `NET_RAW` capability allows the container to create raw sockets, which are essential for packet crafting and network sniffing tools like `arpspoof`. By disallowing `NET_RAW`, Kubernetes policies prevent containers from performing these types of attacks.

### Preventing the Attack

The security policy should disallow `NET_RAW` to mitigate such risks. Here’s how you can enforce this:

```yaml
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sPSPAllowedCapabilities
metadata:
  name: disallow-capabilities
spec:
  match:
    kinds:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        kinds: ["Pod"]
  parameters:
    allowedCapabilities:
      - AUDIT_WRITE
      - CHOWN
      - DAC_OVERRIDE
      - FOWNER
      - FSETID
      - KILL
      - MKNOD
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
      - SETFCAP
      - SETGID
      - SETPCAP
      - SETUID
      - SYS_CHROOT
  validation:
    message: >-
      Any capabilities added beyond the allowed list (AUDIT_WRITE, CHOWN, DAC_OVERRIDE, FOWNER,
      FSETID, KILL, MKNOD, NET_BIND_SERVICE, SETFCAP, SETGID, SETPCAP, SETUID, SYS_CHROOT)
      are disallowed.
    deny:
      conditions:
        all:
          - key: "spec.initContainers[*].securityContext.capabilities.add"
            operator: NotIn
            values:
              - AUDIT_WRITE
              - CHOWN
              - DAC_OVERRIDE
              - FOWNER
              - FSETID
              - KILL
              - MKNOD
              - NET_BIND_SERVICE
              - SETFCAP
              - SETGID
              - SETPCAP
              - SETUID
              - SYS_CHROOT
          - key: "spec.containers[*].securityContext.capabilities.add"
            operator: NotIn
            values:
              - AUDIT_WRITE
              - CHOWN
              - DAC_OVERRIDE
              - FOWNER
              - FSETID
              - KILL
              - MKNOD
              - NET_BIND_SERVICE
              - SETFCAP
              - SETGID
              - SETPCAP
              - SETUID
              - SYS_CHROOT
```

### Expected Error Message

If the policy disallows `NET_RAW`, attempting to create `badpod04` will result in an error:

```
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "badpod04.yaml": admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: Any capabilities added beyond the allowed list (AUDIT_WRITE, CHOWN, DAC_OVERRIDE, FOWNER, FSETID, KILL, MKNOD, NET_BIND_SERVICE, SETFCAP, SETGID, SETPCAP, SETUID, SYS_CHROOT) are disallowed.
```

### Summary

By enforcing policies that disallow the `NET_RAW` capability, Kubernetes clusters can effectively prevent containers from executing network attacks such as ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, and other malicious activities that require raw socket access. This helps maintain the security and integrity of the cluster and its network environment.
