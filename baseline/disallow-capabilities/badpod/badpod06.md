Let's use the provided example Pod definition to illustrate the potential risks and why the `NET_RAW` and `SYS_ADMIN` capabilities are disallowed.

### Pod YAML Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: badpod06
spec:
  initContainers:
  - name: initcontainer01
    image: busybox
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add:
        - NET_RAW  # Disallowed capability
  containers:
  - name: container01
    image: busybox
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add:
        - SYS_ADMIN  # Disallowed capability
```

### Example Attack: Packet Sniffing and Privilege Escalation

This Pod attempts to use two highly privileged capabilities: `NET_RAW` in the init container and `SYS_ADMIN` in the main container. Here's how these can be exploited:

1. **NET_RAW Capability in initContainer: Packet Sniffing**

   The `NET_RAW` capability allows the creation of raw sockets, which can be used for packet sniffing. An attacker can intercept network traffic within the Kubernetes cluster.

2. **SYS_ADMIN Capability in main Container: Privilege Escalation**

   The `SYS_ADMIN` capability grants a wide range of administrative privileges, which can be used to manipulate the system at a low level. This includes mounting filesystems, configuring network interfaces, and other critical operations.

### Steps to Perform the Attacks

#### Packet Sniffing with `NET_RAW`

1. **Install Necessary Tools**

   First, install tools like `tcpdump` in the init container:

   ```sh
   kubectl exec -it badpod06 -c initcontainer01 -- sh
   apk update && apk add tcpdump
   ```

2. **Start Packet Sniffing**

   Use `tcpdump` to capture network traffic:

   ```sh
   tcpdump -i eth0 -w /tmp/capture.pcap
   ```

   This command captures all packets on the `eth0` interface and writes them to a file named `capture.pcap`.

#### Privilege Escalation with `SYS_ADMIN`

1. **Install Necessary Tools**

   First, install tools like `mount` and `nsenter` in the main container:

   ```sh
   kubectl exec -it badpod06 -c container01 -- sh
   apk update && apk add util-linux
   ```

2. **Mount the Host Filesystem**

   Use the `SYS_ADMIN` capability to mount the host filesystem:

   ```sh
   mkdir /mnt/host
   mount -t hostfs / /mnt/host
   ```

   This command mounts the root filesystem of the host to `/mnt/host` inside the container, potentially allowing the attacker to access and manipulate host files.

### Why These Capabilities Are Disallowed

- **NET_RAW**: Allows the creation of raw sockets, which can be used for packet sniffing, network reconnaissance, and various network attacks. This capability can compromise network security within the Kubernetes cluster.
- **SYS_ADMIN**: Grants extensive administrative privileges, including mounting filesystems, configuring network interfaces, and more. This capability can be exploited for privilege escalation and full control over the host system.

### Preventing the Attack

To prevent such attacks, ensure that the `NET_RAW` and `SYS_ADMIN` capabilities are disallowed by the security policy. Hereâ€™s how you can enforce this:

```yaml
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sPSPAllowedCapabilities
metadata:
  name: disallow-capabilities
spec:
  match:
    kinds:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        kinds: ["Pod"]
  parameters:
    allowedCapabilities:
      - AUDIT_WRITE
      - CHOWN
      - DAC_OVERRIDE
      - FOWNER
      - FSETID
      - KILL
      - MKNOD
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
      - SETFCAP
      - SETGID
      - SETPCAP
      - SETUID
      - SYS_CHROOT
  validation:
    message: >-
      Any capabilities added beyond the allowed list (AUDIT_WRITE, CHOWN, DAC_OVERRIDE, FOWNER,
      FSETID, KILL, MKNOD, NET_BIND_SERVICE, SETFCAP, SETGID, SETPCAP, SETUID, SYS_CHROOT)
      are disallowed.
    deny:
      conditions:
        all:
          - key: "spec.initContainers[*].securityContext.capabilities.add"
            operator: NotIn
            values:
              - AUDIT_WRITE
              - CHOWN
              - DAC_OVERRIDE
              - FOWNER
              - FSETID
              - KILL
              - MKNOD
              - NET_BIND_SERVICE
              - SETFCAP
              - SETGID
              - SETPCAP
              - SETUID
              - SYS_CHROOT
          - key: "spec.containers[*].securityContext.capabilities.add"
            operator: NotIn
            values:
              - AUDIT_WRITE
              - CHOWN
              - DAC_OVERRIDE
              - FOWNER
              - FSETID
              - KILL
              - MKNOD
              - NET_BIND_SERVICE
              - SETFCAP
              - SETGID
              - SETPCAP
              - SETUID
              - SYS_CHROOT
```

### Expected Error Message

If the policy disallows `NET_RAW` and `SYS_ADMIN`, attempting to create `badpod06` will result in an error:

```
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "badpod06.yaml": admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: Any capabilities added beyond the allowed list (AUDIT_WRITE, CHOWN, DAC_OVERRIDE, FOWNER, FSETID, KILL, MKNOD, NET_BIND_SERVICE, SETFCAP, SETGID, SETPCAP, SETUID, SYS_CHROOT) are disallowed.
```

### Summary

By enforcing policies that disallow the `NET_RAW` and `SYS_ADMIN` capabilities, Kubernetes clusters can effectively prevent containers from executing network attacks such as packet sniffing and privilege escalation. This helps maintain the security and integrity of the cluster and its network environment.
