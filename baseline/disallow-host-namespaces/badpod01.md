### Attack Example: Host PID Namespace Exploitation

In this scenario, we will explore how an attacker can exploit the `hostPID: true` setting in a Pod to gain visibility into the host's processes and potentially interfere with them.

#### Pod YAML Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: badpod01
spec:
  hostPID: true
  containers:
  - name: container01
    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c", "sleep 3600"]
```

#### Attack Scenario

1. **Pod Creation**

   The attacker creates the Pod `badpod01` with `hostPID: true`, allowing the container to see all the processes running on the host.

2. **Enumerating Host Processes**

   Once the Pod is running, the attacker can execute commands within the container to list all the processes on the host.

   ```sh
   kubectl exec -it badpod01 -- sh
   ps -ef
   ```

   This command will display a list of all processes running on the host, including those not related to the container.

3. **Identifying Sensitive Processes**

   The attacker can look for sensitive or critical processes, such as:
   - Kubernetes control plane components (`kube-apiserver`, `kube-scheduler`, etc.)
   - System services (`sshd`, `nginx`, etc.)

4. **Interfering with Host Processes**

   By using the process IDs (PIDs) obtained from the `ps -ef` command, the attacker can send signals to these processes. For example, to terminate a critical service:

   ```sh
   kill -9 <pid>
   ```

   Where `<pid>` is the PID of a critical process.

#### Impact of the Attack

- **Denial of Service**: Terminating critical processes can cause disruptions in the host's services, leading to a denial of service.
- **Privilege Escalation**: By manipulating or inspecting host processes, an attacker may find ways to escalate privileges or gather sensitive information.

### Mitigation

To mitigate these risks, ensure that Pods do not use the `hostPID` setting unless absolutely necessary. Implement policies to enforce this.

#### Gatekeeper Policy Example

```yaml
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sNoHostNamespaces
metadata:
  name: disallow-host-pid
spec:
  match:
    kinds:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        kinds: ["Pod"]
  validation:
    message: "Using hostPID is disallowed."
    deny:
      conditions:
        any:
          - key: "spec.hostPID"
            operator: In
            values: [true]
```

### Expected Error Message

If the policy disallows `hostPID`, attempting to create `badpod01` will result in an error:

```
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "badpod01.yaml": admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: Using hostPID is disallowed.
```

### Summary

Disallowing `hostPID` in Kubernetes pods prevents containers from seeing and interacting with host processes, thereby enhancing the security and integrity of the host system. Use policies to enforce these restrictions and ensure a secure cluster environment.
