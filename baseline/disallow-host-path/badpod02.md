### Attack Example: HostPath Volume and emptyDir Volume Exploitation

In this scenario, we will explore how an attacker can exploit a Pod configured with both a `hostPath` volume and an `emptyDir` volume. The `hostPath` volume grants access to sensitive host files, while the `emptyDir` volume provides a temporary storage space that can be used for staging attacks or temporary data manipulation.

#### Pod YAML Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: badpod02
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container01
    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c", "sleep 3600"]
    volumeMounts:
      - name: udev
        mountPath: /data
      - name: temp
        mountPath: /scratch
  volumes:
  - name: temp
    emptyDir: {}
  - name: udev
    hostPath:
      path: /etc/udev
```

#### Attack Scenario

1. **Pod Creation**

   The attacker creates the Pod `badpod02` with a `hostPath` volume that mounts the host's `/etc/udev` directory into the container at `/data`, and an `emptyDir` volume that mounts a temporary directory at `/scratch`.

2. **Accessing Host Files**

   Once the Pod is running, the attacker can execute commands within the container to access files in the mounted host directory:

   ```sh
   kubectl exec -it badpod02 -- sh
   ls /data
   ```

   This command lists the contents of the `/etc/udev` directory on the host.

3. **Reading and Modifying Configuration Files**

   The attacker can read and modify files in the `/etc/udev` directory to gather sensitive information or disrupt host operations:

   - **Reading Configuration**:

     ```sh
     cat /data/udev.conf
     ```

   - **Modifying Configuration**:

     ```sh
     echo "malicious configuration" >> /data/udev.conf
     ```

4. **Using emptyDir for Temporary Storage**

   The attacker can use the `emptyDir` volume at `/scratch` for various purposes:

   - **Staging Malicious Scripts**: Download or create malicious scripts in `/scratch`:

     ```sh
     echo "malicious script" > /scratch/malicious.sh
     chmod +x /scratch/malicious.sh
     ```

   - **Temporary Data Storage**: Store temporary data for staging attacks or transferring files:

     ```sh
     cp /data/important_config.conf /scratch/
     ```

5. **Combining Access**

   The attacker can combine access to the host's `/etc/udev` directory with the `emptyDir` volume for more complex attacks:

   - **Backup and Replace Configuration**: Back up the original configuration file to `/scratch` before modifying it:

     ```sh
     cp /data/udev.conf /scratch/udev.conf.bak
     echo "malicious configuration" > /data/udev.conf
     ```

   - **Exfiltrate Data**: Temporarily store sensitive data in `/scratch` before transferring it out of the container:

     ```sh
     cp /data/sensitive_data /scratch/
     ```

#### Impact of the Attack

- **Configuration Tampering**: Unauthorized modifications to udev configurations can alter the host's device management behavior, potentially introducing security vulnerabilities or instability.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure**: Reading configuration files can reveal sensitive information about the host's device settings and policies.
- **Data Staging**: Using `emptyDir` volumes for temporary storage can facilitate more complex attacks and data exfiltration.

### Mitigation

To mitigate these risks, ensure that Pods do not use `hostPath` volumes to mount sensitive directories unless absolutely necessary and implement policies to enforce this.

#### Gatekeeper Policy Example

```yaml
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sNoHostPath
metadata:
  name: disallow-hostpath
spec:
  match:
    kinds:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        kinds: ["Pod"]
  validation:
    message: "Using hostPath volumes to mount sensitive host directories is disallowed."
    deny:
      conditions:
        all:
          - key: "spec.volumes[*].hostPath.path"
            operator: In
            values:
              - /etc/udev
              - /etc/passwd
              - /etc/shadow
              - /var/lib/kubelet
              - /etc/kubernetes
```

### Expected Error Message

If the policy disallows `hostPath` volumes for sensitive directories, attempting to create `badpod02` will result in an error:

```
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "badpod02.yaml": admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: Using hostPath volumes to mount sensitive host directories is disallowed.
```

### Summary

Disallowing the use of `hostPath` volumes to mount sensitive directories in Kubernetes pods prevents containers from accessing and tampering with critical host files, while also controlling the use of temporary storage provided by `emptyDir` volumes. This enhances the security and integrity of the host system. Use policies to enforce these restrictions and ensure a secure cluster environment.
